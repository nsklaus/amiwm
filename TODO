I found out that it is only the xclipboard icon that disappears when
I drag screens.

1. Occaisionally, when iconifying, the icon appears on top of
   another icon.

2. If xv opens a window on a split screen (i.e. a screen which has
   been dragged down a bit), the window only appears on the front
   most screen but the origin of the window is at the top left
   of the monitor.

# amiwm
Amiga Workbench inspired window manager for Xorg.

## Getting started
Before compiling, make sure that you have following packages installed:

```
gcc make autoconf xorg xorg-xinit xorg-dev
```

First, run configuration script:

```
./configure
```

After that, you can either edit the Makefile, or leave it as is. After that, compile and install amiwm using

```
make
sudo make install
```

Hopefully, your compilation was succesfull - now you should have amiwm installed!

## Launching amiwm
To launch amiwm, use

```
startx amiwm
```

Or add "amiwm" to your xinitrc file

## Configuration
Configuration utility is not yet available; To configure amiwm, you'll need
to create and edit .amiwmrc file in your home directory. To do so, read
amiwm's manpage.

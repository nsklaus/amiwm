Installing instructions for amiwm:

UNIX
----

1. Run configure

Type './configure' in the source directory.  Extensive probing of
your system configuration will take place for quite a while.

2. Inspect the Makefile

configure will create a Makefile for you.  This contains a few
variables you might want to edit.  'prefix' is where amiwm will
be installed, usually /usr/local.  The binary will be installed
in 'bindir' (default $prefix/bin) and the support files in 'AMIWM_HOME'
(default $libdir/amiwm, which in turn defaults to $prefix/lib/amiwm).
AMIWM_HOME must be set to a directory where amiwm will be able to
find it's support files before you compile, even if you do not
intend to run 'make install'.

3. Compile

Type 'make' and wait...

4. Install

Type 'make install', and the program with its support files will
be installed in their permanent locations.

5. Install CDE extras (CDE only)

If you're running CDE you may want to do 'make cde-install' as root.
This will enable a new session type (AmiWM Session) in dtlogin.  This
has only been tested on Solaris 2.6, so do it at your own risk...  :)


If all the steps are successfull, you may then remove the source tree.

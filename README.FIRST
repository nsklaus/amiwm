Important notice:

As of version 0.19pl28, amiwm has moved from xmkmf to autoconf
as configuration system.  In this process, some of the installation
procedure was reworked.  As a result, files may be installed in
a different location than before.  It is therefore recommended,
if you have a previously installed amiwm with a version lower than
0.19pl28, that you remove this old version completely before
installing this new version.

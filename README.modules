Background module
-----------------

To get background images on your screens, use the Background module.
The Module command should come after the Screen command, and the
initstring should be the filename of the picture(*).  Example:

Screen "My Screen"
Module "Background" "/users/marcus/gfx/AMIGA.gif"

The Background module is really a shell script that requires that the
program 'xloadimage' is in the PATH of amiwm.

(*) Because xloadimage is used, the initstring may also contain flags to
    xloadimage, like -fullscreen, or -colors.  Like this:
    Module "Background" "-colors 100 -fullscreen /users/marcus/gfx/Amy.gif"



Keyboard module
---------------

With the Keyboard module, you can bind window manager functions to keys
on the keyboard.  The initstring should consist of keybindings on the
form

modifiers<keysym>:where:func

modifiers
=========

Modifiers is 0 or more of:
  Shift Control Meta Lock
  Mod1 Mod2 Mod3 Mod4 Mod5
  Button1 Button2 Button3 Button4 Button5

The modifiers listed must be pressed together with the key to activate
the binding.

keysym
======

Keysym is a standard X keysym name, like F1 or Prior.

where
=====

where is either "all", or one or more of window, frame, icon, root
separated with '|' (bar).  This controls in what areas of the screen
that the key will be active.

func
====

The function to perform when the key is pressed.
Currently the following are defined:

rotatescreens  -  Move the frontmost screen to the back
front          -  Move the window in which the key is pressed to the front
back           -  Move the window in which the key is pressed to the back
iconify        - Iconify the window in which the key is pressed


Example:

Module "Keyboard" "\
	Meta<F1>:window|frame:front\
	Meta<F2>:window|frame:iconify\
	Meta<F3>:window|frame:back"

This binds the keys Meta-F1, Meta-F2 and Meta-F3 to front, back and
iconify respectively.  The will only have effect inside windows and in
window frames.  (These are the only places that front/iconfy/back has
effect anyway.)
